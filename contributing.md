# Send your tip!

The purpose of this handbook is to learn how to use JS language features without losing performance.

You can check [Six Speed](https://kpdecker.github.io/six-speed/) to see how much faster ES6 runs. Also, [Node Green](http://node.green/) displays the native support of each feature.

If you want to submit a tip, create a PR in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters).

Before adding your tip, take into consideration the following guidelines:

- Add your tip in the correct section. Each folder is a different section (for example [v8-tips](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/tree/master/v8-tips) or [workflow](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/tree/master/workflow)).
- Inside the folder, each file is a tip.
- If your tip is very similar to a tip that already exists, consider extending the first tip.
- Don't add more than one tip per file.
- The text that describes the tip should be concise and precise.
- Avoid bloated tips - you can reference other tips instead.
- Add the correct [resources](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/blob/master/resources.md) associated with the tip.
