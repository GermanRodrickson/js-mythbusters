The purpose of esta handbook is the last language use features without losing performance.

You can see on [Six Speed](https://kpdecker.github.io/six-speed/) how faster ES6 run. Also use [Node Green](http://node.green/) to know the native support of each feature.

If you want to submit a tip, create a PR in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters).

Before adding your tip, take into consideration the following guidelines:

- Add your tip in the correct section. Each different section is a folder (for example [v8-tips](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/tree/master/v8-tips) or [workflow](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/tree/master/workflow)).
- Inside the folder, each file is a tip.
- If your tip is very similar to a tip that already exists, consider extending the first tip.
- Don't add more than one tip per file.
- The text that describes the tip has to be concise and precise.
- To avoid extending tips till they are too big, you can reference other tips instead.
- Add the correct [resources](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/blob/master/resources.md) associated with the tip.
