# Send your tip!

To submit a tip, create a PR in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters).

Before adding your tip take into consideration the following guidelines:

- Add your tip in the correct section. Each different section is a folder (for example [v8-tips](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/tree/master/v8-tips) or [workflow](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/tree/master/workflow)).
- Inside the folder, each file is a tip.
- If your tip is very similar to a tip that already exists, consider extending the first tip.
- Don't add more than one tip per file.
- The text that describes the tip has to be concise and precise.
- To avoid extending tips till they are too big, you can reference other tips instead.
