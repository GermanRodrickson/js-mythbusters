#### Use Math native methods

No matter how optimize your JavaScript code is, it will never be faster tahn the native methods provided by the JavaScript Engine.

The reason for this is simple: the native parts of JavaScript are all writen in a lower-level language such as C++. That means these methods are compiled down to machine code as part of the browser and therefore don't have the same limitations as your code.

The `Math` object contains properties and metods designed to make mathematical operations easier. There are several matematical constans available:

| Constant      | Meaning                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Math.E`      | The value of `E`, the base of the natural logarithms |
| `Math.LN10`   | The natural logarithm of 10                          |
| `Math.LN2`    | The natural logarithm of 2                           |
| `Math.LOG2E`  | The base-2 logarithm of `E`                          |
| `Math.Log10E` | The base-10 logarithm of `E`                         |
| `Math.PI`     | The value of Ï€                                       |
| `Math.SQRT1_2`| The square root of 1/2                               |
| `Math.SQRT2`  | The square root of 2                                 |

Each of these values is precalculated, so there is no need for you to calculate them yourself. There are also method to handle mathematical calculations:

| Method                  | Meaning                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| `Math.abs(num)`         | The absolute value of num |
| `Math.exp(num)`         | Math.e**num               |
| `Math.log(num)`         | The logarithm of num      |
| `Math.pow(num, power)`  | num**power                |
| `Math.sqrt(num)`        | The square root of num    |
| `Math.acos(x)`          | The arc cosine of x       |
